# chime-fullstack-project

### Introduction

Hello, thank you for considering Chime! We have designed this project-based interview to create a better interview experience for you; if you would prefer a traditional interview please let us know (this will have no impact on your interview). If this takes you longer than 4 hours please stop and send us what you have.

Out of respect for other candidates, please complete this project independently. You may use online resources but do not copy code.

You may use 3rd party libraries and use any online resources you would like.

### Description

Because we are in the restaurant industry, your project-based interview will be a very basic interface to add `menu items` to a database.

The interface must have a list view of all `menu items` in the database. The interface must also have a way to add a `menu item` (a `menu item` only requires a name).

Additionally, the user must be able to create `tags` independently of `menu items` and must have some way of creating a `menu item` with a `tag` (a `menu item` only has one `tag`). A `tag` only requires a `name`.

For example, the user can create a `tag` with the `name` “fruit”. Then, they can add a `menu item` with the `name` “apple” and the previously created `tag` with `name` “fruit”. The `menu item` with `name` “apple” should now show up in a list view in the interface.

**You only need to build an interface to add a tag, create an item with an existing tag, and view all items.**

### Getting started

To save you time we have written some boilerplate and example code for you. You must use this boilerplate environment.

Getting started instructions for the frontend and backend can be found in the readme's in the `/frontend` and `/backend` directories.

### Submission

Please create a public repository on GitHub and email `eric@chimemenu.com` a link to the repository.

### What we're looking for

Because this is a holistic assessment, we are looking at several factors including:

- Your code, SQL, and API design
- Your thought process
- Your approach to designing a user interface (don’t worry, this isn’t a design interview)

### Why project-based interview?

We chose a project based interview for several reasons:

- To create a setting in which you feel comfortable & can give the best representation of your talent
- To give you an opportunity to present your holistic knowledge of full stack development
- To give you an idea of the stack we use
- To give you room for creativity

That being said, please let us know if you would prefer a traditional interview.
